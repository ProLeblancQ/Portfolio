          Hi, I'm Quentin and welcome to my portfolio. Here you can find how to contact me, info on some of my projects, and more.
          <br />
          I am currently looking for an apprenticeship in web development to obtain a Bachelor's degree (bac +4) as an Application Designer and Developer. I'm also open to working directly without this last degree.
          <br />
          After years in the culinary field, I transitioned to web and mobile development ðŸ’». I initially thought this career change was impossible due to my educational background, which was heavily oriented towards the culinary arts. However, I was able to fulfill this dream at ForEach Academy.
          <br />
          I love challenges, teamwork, and continuous learning. My unique background gives me precision and creativity, which I now apply to my new career.
